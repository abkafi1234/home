Welcome! 👋  
I’m **Md Abdullah Al Kafi**, a Lecturer at the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**, [Daffodil International University](https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/), Bangladesh.  

My research focuses on **Multimodal and Resource-Efficient Artificial Intelligence**, spanning **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Speech and Voice Processing**, and **Computer Vision**.  
I’m particularly interested in developing **optimization-driven AI models** for **low-resource and morphologically rich languages**, especially **Bengali**.  

My broader goal is to create **efficient, inclusive, and adaptable AI systems** that can operate across **text, speech, and visual modalities**, empowering technology in linguistically diverse and resource-constrained environments.
